About the Over/Under Movement Data
This table shows the number of games that went over the closing totals line, based on the difference between the opening and closing totals line.

For example, a "Movement" value of 3 means that the over/under line increased by three points between opening and closing. If a game opens with an over/under line of 47 but closes with a line of 50, the game is considered to have a total line movement of 3.

Negative "Movement" values, on the other hand, indicate the over/under line decreasing. If a game opens with an over/under line of 47 but closes with a line of 44, the game is considered to have a total line movement of -3.

Over Record and Over % refer to the number of games that went over vs. under for each matching scenario, measured against the closing total. Pushes are ignored in the calculation of Over %.

Key Takeaways from Over/Under Line Movement Data
This data analyzes how total line movement affects the likelihood of games going Over or Under, based on the difference between the opening and closing totals line.

1. Extreme Line Movements (9+ Points)
📌 Key Trends:

Biggest Over Trend: +10 points → 76.5% Over (13-4-0)

Biggest Under Trend: +11 points → 27.3% Over (3-8-0)

Biggest Over Trend for Negative Movement: -9 points → 68.2% Over (15-7-2)

Biggest Under Trend for Negative Movement: -8.5 points → 37.1% Over (13-22-1)

💡 Betting Edge:

Massive line jumps of +10 points or more → Strong Over Trend (~75%)

Massive negative line movements (-8.5 or more) → Strong Under Trend (~37-45%)

9-point drops see an unusual Over bias (68.2%), suggesting market overreaction.

2. Moderate Line Movements (5-8 Points)
📌 Key Trends:

Best Over Trends:

+6 points → 52.8% Over (142-127-3)

+4.5 points → 51.6% Over (425-399-4)

+4 points → 51.7% Over (619-578-18)

Strongest Under Trends:

+7.5 points → 35.8% Over (34-61-0)

+5.5 points → 48.3% Over (186-199-2)

💡 Betting Edge:

If the total rises by 6+ points, Overs tend to hit slightly (~52-53%).

If the total rises by 7.5 points, the Under has a massive edge (~64%).

3. Small Line Movements (0.5-4 Points)
📌 Key Trends:

Very small movements (0 to +3.5) do not offer much edge.

+3.5 → 49.7% Over, basically a coin flip.

+2 to +2.5 range slightly leans Over (~51.1-51.9%) but nothing major.

💡 Betting Edge:

Minimal movement means no strong Over/Under bias.

If a total rises only 0.5 to 3.5 points, there is no major betting edge (~49-51%).

4. Line Movement in the Negative Direction (Totals Dropping)
📌 Key Trends:

Biggest Over Trends:

-9 points → 68.2% Over (15-7-2)

-3.5 points → 51.6% Over (735-689-10)

-7 points → 54.9% Over (56-46-0)

Strongest Under Trends:

-7.5 points → 41.1% Over (30-43-1)

-8.5 points → 37.1% Over (13-22-1)

-10 points → 42.1% Over (8-11-0)

💡 Betting Edge:

If a total drops significantly (-7.5 points or more), the Under performs well (~60-63%).

Moderate drops (-3.5 to -7) slightly favor the Over.
