About the Over/Under Movement Data
These tables show the number of games that went over the closing totals line, based on the difference between the opening and closing totals line, as well has how high that line opened.

-
The data is grouped into separate tables based on the opening totals line, ranging from games with low totals to those with high totals. Within the tables, each line represents a different amount of movement away from that original total, ranging from a large move toward the over to a large move toward the under.

Over Record and Over % refer to the number of games that went over vs. under for each matching scenario, measured against the closing total. Pushes are ignored in the calculation of Over %.

Key Takeaways from Over/Under Results by Opening Line
This dataset examines how total movement relative to the opening line affects Over/Under results.

1. Small Totals (‚â§125.5) ‚Äì Strongest Under Trends
üìå Key Trends:
‚úÖ **If the total moves 3+ points toward the Under, the Under hits 60.3% (117-77-1).
‚úÖ If the total moves 2-2.5 points toward the Under, the Under hits 53.5% (151-131-9).
‚úÖ If the total stays the same, the Over hits 53.3% (513-449-22).
