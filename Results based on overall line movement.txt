About the Over/Under Movement Data
These tables show the number of games that went over the closing totals line, based on the difference between the opening and closing totals line, as well has how high that line opened.

-
The data is grouped into separate tables based on the direction and size of the totals line movement associated with each game, ranging from large moves toward the over to large move towards the under. Within the tables, each line represents a different range of opening totals lines, from games with low totals to those with high totals.

Over Record and Over % refer to the number of games that went over vs. under for each matching scenario, measured against the closing total. Pushes are ignored in the calculation of Over %.

This data offers valuable insights into how line movement impacts Over/Under outcomes in college basketball. Here are some key takeaways:

Strongest Over Trends

When the closing total remains the same as the opening line, the Over tends to hit slightly more often (51.4% overall).

A 3+ point move toward the Over results in a near 50/50 split (49.8%), showing that heavy movement toward the Over isn't necessarily predictive.

Strongest Under Trends

When the total moves 3+ points toward the Under on lower lines (0-125.5), the Under wins significantly (60.3%).

A 2-2.5 point move toward the Under has slight value (50.5% overall), but effectiveness varies by total range.

Games with a 151+ opening total that move 3+ points toward the Under trend more toward the Under (47.5% Over rate).

Neutral Line Movement

Games with minimal movement (0.5-1.5 points in either direction) are almost exactly 50/50, meaning sharp action isn’t creating clear Over/Under edges.

A 2-2.5 point move toward the Over or Under tends to hover around 50%, with no strong predictive value.

Potential Betting Strategies
Consider the Under in Low Total Games (0-125.5) when the total moves 3+ points down (60.3% hit rate).

Avoid blindly following large Over movements (3+ points toward Over), as they win only 49.8% of the time.

Games where the line doesn’t move tend to slightly favor the Over (51.4% overall), suggesting oddsmakers often set accurate initial totals.

High total games (151+) moving 3+ toward the Under have a strong Under trend (47.5% Over rate), suggesting sharp money might be fading offensive expectations.
