About the Spread Movement Data
These tables show the ATS record of opening favorites in a game against the closing spread, based on the difference between the opening and closing point spread, as well as what that opening spread was.

The data is grouped into separate tables based on the value of the opening spread, ranging from small favorites to large ones. Within the tables, each line represents a different amount of movement away from that opening spread, ranging from large moves toward the opening favorite to large moves away from the opening favorite.

Opening Fav Record and Cover % refer to the ATS (against the spread) record of the opening favorite for each matching scenario, measured against the closing spread. Pushes are ignored in the calculation of Cover %.

Key Insights from the Spread Movement Data (ATS Performance by Opening Favorite Range)
This dataset breaks down how opening favorites perform ATS (Against the Spread) based on different ranges of opening spreads and how the line moves. Here are some key takeaways:

1. Small Favorites (1 to 2.5 Points)
Opening favorites in this range covered 50.9% overall (7391-7136-284).

Biggest ATS Advantage:

3+ points toward the opening favorite: 52.3% (181-165-8).

3+ points toward the underdog: 51.6% (592-555-15).

Observations:

Big movements (+3 or more) in either direction seem to suggest a slight edge for the favorite.

Otherwise, movement in smaller increments (0.5 to 2.5 points) doesn’t provide much edge.

2. Moderate Favorites (3 to 6.5 Points)
Opening favorites covered 50.4% overall (12136-11938-504).

Biggest ATS Advantage:

3+ points toward the opening favorite: 52.4% (231-210-9).

No movement (closing line = opening line): 51.1% (2609-2497-102).

Observations:

When the line moves strongly toward the favorite (3+ points), it suggests an edge.

The worst-performing range is 2 to 2.5 points toward the underdog (49.1%), implying that sharp movement against the favorite may be meaningful.

3. Touchdown Favorites (7 to 9.5 Points)
Opening favorites covered 50.2% overall (6445-6396-241).

Biggest ATS Advantage:

2 to 2.5 points toward the underdog: 51.4% (358-338-16).

Observations:

No major ATS edges, but favorites tend to perform slightly better when there is little to no movement.

3+ point movement toward either side doesn’t show a strong trend.

4. Double-Digit Favorites (10 to 13.5 Points)
Opening favorites covered 49.4% overall (5316-5445-211).

Biggest ATS Advantage:

2 to 2.5 points toward the favorite: 54.6% (277-230-9) → Best performing trend in the entire dataset.

Biggest ATS Disadvantage:

3+ points toward the favorite: 47.0% (102-115-2).

Small movements (0.5 to 1.5 points) toward the favorite: 48.0% (1466-1587-52).

Observations:

Large favorites with a moderate 2-2.5 point line move in their favor perform very well (54.6%).

If the line moves 3+ points toward the favorite, they perform poorly (47.0%), suggesting overcorrection.

Small movements don’t help favorites in this range.

5. Large Favorites (14+ Points)
Opening favorites covered 48.7% overall (5645-5946-206).

Biggest ATS Advantage:

3+ points toward the favorite: 51.1% (265-254-5).

Biggest ATS Disadvantage:

0.5 to 1.5 points toward the favorite: 47.6% (1368-1503-52).

No movement: 48.7% (1223-1290-51).

Observations:

Big favorites struggle ATS in general (sub-50% overall).

Small movement toward the favorite (0.5 to 1.5) seems to be a red flag (47.6%).

Large movement (3+ points) toward the favorite slightly helps.

Overall Trends and Takeaways
✅ Large movement toward a double-digit favorite (3+ points) is a fade signal → They cover only 47.0%.
✅ Moderate movement (2-2.5 points) toward a double-digit favorite is a strong signal → They cover 54.6%.
✅ Small movements (0.5 to 1.5 points) toward big favorites (10+ points) are often bad → This range consistently underperforms.
✅ Small favorites (1-2.5 points) do slightly better when the line moves significantly (+3 or more).
✅ In most cases, when the line moves moderately toward the underdog, favorites slightly struggle.
